          <p class="mb-4">Cataract is a leading cause of age-related preventable blindness worldwide. An estimated 20 lakh new cataract cases are seen in India every year, and cataract blindness can be completely avoided.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">This condition develops due to clouding of the eye's natural crystalline lens caused by protein buildup. 80% of blindness in India is due to cataract, typically affecting people over 60 years old. Symptoms include blurred vision, light sensitivity, and color fading.</p>
          <p>Our advanced cataract surgery replaces the cloudy lens with an artificial intraocular lens. With quick recovery time and personalized treatment plans, we help restore clear vision and improve quality of life.</p>
