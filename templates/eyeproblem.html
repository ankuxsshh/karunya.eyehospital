        <h3 class="mb-3">What is Cataract?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Your eyes have a crystalline lens that is normally transparent and helps focus light on the
          retina, similar to a movie screen. This lens sits inside a thin capsular bag. With age, the lens undergoes
          changes that cause it to lose transparency and become opaque. This clouding of the lens is called cataract.
          The opacity prevents light from passing through properly, resulting in blurred vision.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-3">How is it treated?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The standard treatment is cataract surgery, typically performed through phacoemulsification.
          Using an operating microscope, surgeons make a tiny incision near the cornea. A thin ultrasound probe is
          inserted into the capsular bag to break up and remove the cloudy lens using ultrasonic vibrations. After
          removing the cataract, an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) is implanted into the same capsular bag to restore
          focusing ability.</p>

        <p>Our advanced cataract surgery replaces the cloudy lens with an artificial intraocular lens. With quick
          recovery time and personalized treatment plans, we help restore clear vision and improve quality of life.</p>

        <h4>Causes</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">Develops due to deteriorating retinal blood vessels in diabetes patients. Nearly all diabetes
          patients show signs after 25 years, with severity linked to blood sugar control.</p>

        <h4>Treatment Options</h4>
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h5>Advanced Eye Injections</h5>
          <p>Anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea) and steroids administered via painless injections to reduce macular
            edema. Performed under topical anesthesia with minimal complications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h5>Laser Photocoagulation</h5>
          <p>Precise laser treatment to seal leaky vessels or shrink abnormal growths. Proven to significantly reduce
            vision loss risk, performed in-office with topical anesthesia.</p>
