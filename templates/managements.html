              Kerala.

              the time
              the hospital started 18 years ago, thanks to the meticulous system initiated by his family. His knowledge
              in the field
              of Opticals and Eye Clinic, has enabled him to relate to doctors and paramedics working in the hospital.
              Before taking
              on the reins of administration at Karunya Eye Hospital, he had extended his knowledge for the growth of
              K.K Opticals &
              Eye Clinic at Adoor, which he has started around 40 years ago. Following the tradition of quality
              treatment at affordable
              cost, he upholds the mantra of the hospital “committed to excellent eye care”.
