                from the time
                the hospital started 18 years ago, thanks to the meticulous system initiated by his family. His
                knowledge in the field
                of Opticals and Eye Clinic, has enabled him to relate to doctors and paramedics working in the hospital.
                Before taking
                on the reins of administration at Karunya Eye Hospital, he had extended his knowledge for the growth of
                K.K Opticals &
                Eye Clinic at Adoor, which he has started around 40 years ago. Following the tradition of quality
                treatment at affordable
                cost, he upholds the mantra of the hospital “committed to excellent eye care”.
